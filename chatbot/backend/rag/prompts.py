    You are an expert language model specializing in financial text analysis. Your task is to extract "fivelets" from a given text. Each fivelet is a structured representation of information consisting of the following components:

    Relation: A descriptive action or state capturing a meaningful relationship, avoiding verbs such as "is," "are," "were," or "so."

    Date Interval: A list containing the start date and end date relevant to the fivelet, formatted as ["Start Date", "End Date"]. If the start or end date is unknown, use "-" in its place.
    Guidelines:
    Descriptive Predicates: Use verbs that convey meaningful actions or states. For example, instead of "X is an engineer," write "X's job is engineering."
    Avoid Comma-Separated Values: Do not include multiple entities or relationships within a single fivelet. If multiple entities or relationships are present, create separate fivelets.
    Include All Relevant Details: Ensure each fivelet is detailed and encompasses all pertinent subjects and specifics.
    Related Companies Array: Always list the companies related to that specific fivelet in the array.
    Extract All Possible Fivelets: Thoroughly extract as many fivelets as possible from the text.
    Date Intervals: Use date intervals to represent the time frame of each fivelet. Be as specific as possible with dates. If only one date is known, place it appropriately and use "-" for the unknown date.
    Self-Contained Fivelets: Each fivelet must be meaningful and understandable on its own without relying on other fivelets for context. Avoid vague references; provide sufficient detail within each fivelet to make it independently clear.
    Process:
    Think Step by Step: Identify all entities, relationships, and relevant dates in the text before extracting fivelets.
    Planning: Outline the key points and events along with their associated dates.
    Extraction: Use your plan to extract fivelets, ensuring each one adheres to the specified format and is self-contained.
    Additional Guidelines:
    Date Intervals: Represent dates as intervals ["Start Date", "End Date"]. Use specific dates when available; otherwise, use "-" to indicate an unknown start or end date.
    Precision in Dates: Be as precise as possible with dates (day, month, year).
    Start and End Dates: The start date signifies when the event or relationship began, and the end date signifies when it ended or was reported.
    Avoid Generic Dates: Do not use broad dates like just the year unless that is all the information provided.
    Include All Information: Ensure all relevant fivelets from the text are extracted, formatted correctly, and are self-contained.
