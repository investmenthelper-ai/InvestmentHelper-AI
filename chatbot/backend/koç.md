The provided financial data is structured in a table format, detailing the financial status over a series of years. Here’s a breakdown of the information presented:

### Header Analysis
- **FİNANSAL DURUM TABLOSU**: This indicates that the table is a financial position statement, commonly known as a balance sheet.
- **Years**: The data spans four periods: December 2021, December 2022, December 2023, and June 2024.

### Row Analysis
1. **Sunum Para Birimi (Presentation Currency)**:
   - The currency is consistently presented as "1000TL" for the year 2021 and "1000000TL" for the subsequent years (2022, 2023, and 2024).
   - This suggests that the financial figures are reported in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL), with the values for 2022, 2023, and 2024 being significantly larger, indicating a possible change in reporting or a significant increase in financial metrics.

2. **Finansal Tablo Niteliği (Nature of Financial Statement)**:
   - All entries are marked as "Konsolide" (Consolidated), indicating that the financial data represents the combined financial position of a parent company and its subsidiaries.
   - This consistency suggests that the financial reporting methodology has remained unchanged across the years.

### Numerical Observations
- **Consistency in Currency**: The presentation currency remains the same, which is crucial for comparative analysis across the years.
- **Lack of Variation in Currency Presentation**: The values for 2022, 2023, and 2024 are all reported as "1000000TL," which may imply that the financial position has stabilized at this level or that there has been no growth or decline in the reported metrics during this period.
- **Consolidation**: The consistent nature of the financial statement being consolidated indicates that the financial health of the entire group of companies has been maintained without significant changes in structure or performance.

### Relationships and Trends
- **Stability**: The data suggests a stable financial position over the years, as indicated by the unchanged presentation currency and the nature of the financial statement.
- **Potential for Growth**: While the figures remain constant, the lack of growth could indicate a need for strategic initiatives to enhance financial performance or address market conditions.

### Conclusion
The financial data indicates a stable consolidated financial position over the observed periods, with no apparent growth or decline in the reported figures. The consistent use of the presentation currency and the nature of the financial statement suggests a steady operational environment for the entity involved. Further analysis would require additional data to assess performance metrics, trends, and potential areas for improvement.

   - **2024/06**: 3,586,889

### Numerical Observations

1. **Growth in Current Assets (Dönen Varlıklar)**:
   - From **2021/12** to **2022/12**, there is a significant increase from 605,974,596 to 982,090, which appears to be a typographical error as the value drastically drops. Assuming the correct trend, the growth from **2022/12** to **2023/12** is from 982,090 to 1,712,378, indicating an increase of 730,288 (approximately 74.4% growth).
   - The growth from **2023/12** to **2024/06** is from 1,712,378 to 2,197,689, which is an increase of 485,311 (approximately 28.3% growth).

2. **Growth in Non-Current Assets (Duran Varlıklar)**:
   - The increase from **2021/12** to **2022/12** is from 414,578,711 to 600,504, which also appears to be a typographical error. Assuming the correct trend, the growth from **2022/12** to **2023/12** is from 600,504 to 1,146,587, indicating an increase of 546,083 (approximately 90.9% growth).
   - The growth from **2023/12** to **2024/06** is from 1,146,587 to 1,389,200, which is an increase of 242,613 (approximately 21.2% growth).

3. **Total Assets (Varlıklar)**:
   - The total assets show a consistent increase over the periods. The growth from **2021/12** to **2022/12** is from 1,020,553,307 to 1,582,594, which again appears to be a typographical error. Assuming the correct trend, the increase from **2022/12** to **2023/12** is from 1,582,594 to 2,858,965, indicating an increase of 1,276,371 (approximately 80.7% growth).
   - The growth from **2023/12** to **2024/06** is from 2,858,965 to 3,586,889, which is an increase of 727,924 (approximately 25.4% growth).

### Relationships and Trends

- **Current vs. Non-Current Assets**: The data suggests that both current and non-current assets are growing, but the growth rates vary. Current assets show a higher percentage growth in the earlier years compared to non-current assets, which may indicate a shift in the company's operational focus or investment strategy.
  
- **Total Assets Growth**: The total assets reflect the combined growth of both current and non-current assets. The overall trend indicates a healthy increase in total assets, suggesting that the company is expanding its asset base.

- **Percentage of Current vs. Non-Current Assets**: The proportion of current assets to total assets can be calculated for each year to assess liquidity. However, due to the apparent errors in the data for 2022, this analysis would require corrected figures for accurate insights.

### Conclusion

The financial data indicates a trend of growth in both current and non-current assets, with total assets also increasing significantly. However, the apparent discrepancies in the 2022 figures suggest a need for verification of the data to ensure accurate analysis. The growth patterns observed could imply a strategic focus on asset accumulation, which may be beneficial for the company's operational capabilities and financial health moving forward.

   **Analysis:**
   - There is a significant decrease from 2021 to 2022, dropping from 63,641,104 to 149,353, which suggests a major financial event or adjustment affecting the equity.
   - From 2022 to 2023, there is a substantial increase from 149,353 to 404,729, indicating a recovery or improvement in the financial position.
   - The growth continues into 2024, with a slight increase to 475,057, suggesting a positive trend in equity.

2. **Ödenmiş Sermaye (Paid-in Capital)**
   - **2021/12:** 2,535,898
   - **2022/12:** 2,536
   - **2023/12:** 2,536
   - **2024/06:** 2,536

   **Analysis:**
   - The paid-in capital remains constant at 2,536 across the years, indicating no new capital contributions or changes in the capital structure during this period.
   - This stability suggests that the company has not issued new shares or altered its capital base, which may reflect a conservative approach to financing.

3. **Kontrol Gücü Olmayan Paylar (Non-controlling Interests)**
   - **2021/12:** 57,463,958
   - **2022/12:** 97,845
   - **2023/12:** 269,543
   - **2024/06:** 319,844

   **Analysis:**
   - Similar to the equity attributable to the parent company, there is a drastic decline from 2021 to 2022, from 57,463,958 to 97,845.
   - The non-controlling interests show a recovery trend from 2022 to 2023, increasing to 269,543, and continuing to rise to 319,844 in 2024.
   - This suggests that the company may have regained or increased its ownership stakes in subsidiaries or that the value of non-controlling interests has improved.

### Relationships and Observations

- **Equity Dynamics:** The drastic drop in both equity attributable to the parent company and non-controlling interests in 2022 indicates a significant event that impacted the company's financial health. The subsequent recovery in 2023 and 2024 suggests effective management strategies or operational improvements.
  
- **Stability in Paid-in Capital:** The constant value of paid-in capital implies that the company has not sought additional equity financing, which could be a strategic choice to maintain control or avoid dilution of existing shares.

- **Proportional Analysis:** 
  - In 2021, the non-controlling interests were significantly higher than the equity attributable to the parent company, indicating a strong presence of minority interests. By 2024, the equity attributable to the parent company has increased, but non-controlling interests still represent a substantial portion of the total equity structure.
  
- **Overall Financial Health:** The trends suggest that while the company faced challenges in 2022, it has shown resilience and a capacity for recovery in the following years, particularly in terms of equity attributable to the parent company and non-controlling interests.

### Conclusion

The financial data reflects a tumultuous period for the company, particularly in 2022, followed by a recovery phase. The stability in paid-in capital indicates a conservative approach to financing, while the trends in equity suggest a positive trajectory moving forward. The analysis highlights the importance of monitoring these figures for ongoing financial health and operational performance.

   - **2024/06**: -603,336

### Numerical Observations

1. **Revenue Trends**:
   - The revenue from financial sector activities shows a significant increase from **73,036,014** in 2021 to **385,624** in 2023, followed by a decrease to **305,219** in 2024. This indicates a peak in 2023, followed by a decline in the first half of 2024.
   - Total revenue also shows a growth trend from **346,688,702** in 2021 to **1,604,647** in 2023, but it drops to **1,009,725** in 2024. This suggests that while there was growth, the latter part of the period saw a contraction.

2. **Cost of Sales**:
   - The cost of sales has increased from **-227,236,375** in 2021 to **-995,950** in 2023, indicating rising costs associated with sales. However, there is a decrease in costs to **-603,336** in 2024, which may suggest improved cost management or reduced sales activity.

3. **Profitability Analysis**:
   - To analyze profitability, we can look at the gross profit, which is calculated as Total Revenue minus Cost of Sales.
   - For **2021/12**: Gross Profit = 346,688,702 - 227,236,375 = 119,452,327
   - For **2022/12**: Gross Profit = 901,857 - 609,386 = 292,471
   - For **2023/12**: Gross Profit = 1,604,647 - 995,950 = 608,697
   - For **2024/06**: Gross Profit = 1,009,725 - 603,336 = 406,389

   This shows that gross profit peaked in 2023 and then decreased in 2024, reflecting the trends in revenue and costs.

4. **Year-over-Year Changes**:
   - The year-over-year change in financial sector activities revenue from 2022 to 2023 is substantial, indicating a growth strategy that may have been effective in 2023.
   - The decline in both financial sector activities revenue and total revenue in 2024 suggests potential challenges or market adjustments.

### Relationships and Insights

- The relationship between revenue and cost of sales indicates that while the company was able to increase its revenue significantly, the costs also rose, impacting overall profitability.
- The decline in both revenues and costs in 2024 could indicate a strategic shift or a response to market conditions, which may need further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.
- The gross profit margins appear to be under pressure in 2024, which could be a concern for future profitability if the trend continues.

### Conclusion

The data reflects a period of growth followed by a contraction in both revenue and costs, particularly in the financial sector activities. The analysis indicates that while the company experienced significant growth in the earlier years, the subsequent decline in 2024 raises questions about sustainability and future strategies. The relationship between revenue and costs will be crucial for maintaining profitability moving forward.

However, there is a decline in gross profit in 2024, dropping to 101.17 thousand. This fluctuation suggests variability in the company’s profitability from its commercial activities.

### Relationships and Observations

- **Cost vs. Gross Profit**: 
  - In 2021, the gross profit of 46.42 million is overshadowed by total costs of -266.62 million, indicating a significant loss overall. 
  - By 2022, while gross profit decreases to 124.48 thousand, total costs also drop significantly, suggesting improved cost management or reduced operational scale.
  - The increase in gross profit to 223.07 thousand in 2023, despite the lack of total cost data, indicates a potential recovery or improvement in commercial activities.

- **Trends**:
  - The financial sector activity costs show a concerning upward trend, which could impact overall profitability if not managed effectively.
  - The gross profit from commercial activities, while increasing, shows volatility, particularly with the drop in 2024, which may warrant further investigation into the factors affecting profitability.

### Conclusion

The data presents a mixed picture of financial health. While there are signs of improved gross profit from commercial activities, the rising costs in the financial sector and the significant total costs in 2021 raise concerns about sustainability. The company may need to focus on controlling costs while maintaining or enhancing revenue generation to ensure long-term viability.
